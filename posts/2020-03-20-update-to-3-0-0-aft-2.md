Hey Lando users! We wanted to let you know about some recent breaking upstream changes and what we've done about them.

As many of you know we rely on other community Docker images to power a good deal of Lando. The main reason for this is we simply do not have the time and resources to manage the _LARGE_ amount of images and versions supported by Lando. This does leave us a bit exposed to breaking upstream changes and yesterday we were hit by a pretty big one. The `tl;dr` is basically all of the images from one of our upstream providers changed and this likely is breaking many of your Lando projects. :(

Until now we've minor version pinned to our upstream images so that users can get a good balance between stability and also regular patch updates to our services. Sadly, it seems like this is no longer a tenable option so we have introduced patch version pinning to a large amount of our images. This should _drastically_ if not outright eliminate this problem from happening again. It does, however, mean that it will be now up to the user to specify new patch versions of a service if they want to get ahead before we are able to update the versions inside of Lando.

The good news is that we now have a new official release that addresses the above. **We recommend you update to the new version immediately and run a `lando rebuild` on any projects that are impacted.**
<https://github.com/lando/lando/releases/tag/v3.0.0-rrc.1>

If that is not reason enough the new release contains additional goodies like:

* Added signed `windoze` installer and binary [#2037](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/2037)

* Added patch version pinning to `bitnami` based services [#2057](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/2057)
* Added `rsync` to the `php:7.4` image [#2056](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/2056)
* Fixed bug causing cli output colorization in non `TTY` contexts [#1789](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/1789)

* Updated functional tests to use `hyperdrive 0.6.1` [#2037](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/2037)

I will also take this opportunity to shamelessly pitch our sponsorship program especially because with more time and resources we can be more proactive in preventing problems like this:

> Lando is **free** and **open source** software that relies on contributions from developers like you! If you like Lando then help us spend more time making, updating and supporting it by [contributing](https://github.com/sponsors/lando).
