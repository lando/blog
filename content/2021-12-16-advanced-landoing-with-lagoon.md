Many users love Lando because of its simplicity: run `lando start` on a project with a Landofile and you're off to the races!

However, there are many powerful features of Lando lurking just beneath the surface that often don't get enough credit. In this webinar with the friendly folks (and Lando sponsorers) at Amazee.io, we explore more advanced topics in Lando like...

- build steps
- tooling
- performance tuning

We also get a chance to talk a bit about the future of Lando and explore the Lando <--> Lagoon integration. Check it out!
