Hey everyone in the Landoverse!

I just wanted to provide some additional notes on the current [v3.9.0 pre-release](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases/tag/v3.9.0) and the forthcoming 3.9.x stable releases.

## 1. U UP?

I'm sure you all have noticed that Lando has slowed its roll of stable releases considerably in 2022. This is not from project abandonment but rather from VERY BIG changes we've been making to the Lando project as a whole, changes we think are essential to power the next big iteration: Lando 4.

Highly encourage you to read the [2022 Review](/blog/2023/01/23/review-of-2022.html) for more detail on that.

## 2. Prepping for Lando 4

As of the [v3.9.0 pre-release](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases/tag/v3.9.0) Lando is now running a completely modularized architecture that brings together 50ish smaller projects, including the new [V4 Runtime](https://github.com/lando/core-next).

This means that we can start rolling out new Lando 4 improvements without messing with your current Lando apps. Buckle up because big changes are coming this year!

For more detail you should check out our [2023 Roadmap](/blog/2023/01/23/roadmap-of-2023.html) post.

## 3. VirtioFS

Also as of the [v3.9.0 pre-release](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases/tag/v3.9.0) and specifically the Docker Desktop 4.16.1 version it ships with, macOS 12.5+ users can take advantage of the new VirtioFS file sharing layer which offers "you definitely should use it" performance improvements.

You can read more about that [here](https://docs.lando.dev/core/v3/performance.html#_1-virtiofs-on-macos).
