Hey everyone in the Landoverse!

I just wanted to provide some additional notes on the current [v3.9.1 pre-release](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases/tag/v3.9.1) and the forthcoming 3.9.x+ stable releases.

## 1. U UP?

I'm sure you all have noticed that Lando slowed its roll of stable releases considerably in 2022. This is not from project abandonment but rather from VERY BIG changes we've been making to the Lando project as a whole, changes we think are essential to power the next big iteration: Lando 4.

If you're curious, I highly encourage you to read the [2022 Review](/blog/2023/01/23/review-of-2022.html) for more detail on that.

## 2. Prepping for Lando 4

As of the [v3.9.1 pre-release](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases/tag/v3.9.1) Lando is now running a completely modularized architecture that brings together 50ish smaller projects, including the new [V4 Runtime](https://github.com/lando/core-next) which will likely `alpha` in April.

This means that we can start rolling out new Lando 4 improvements without messing with your current Lando apps. Buckle up because big changes are coming this year!

For more detail you should check out our [2023 Roadmap](/blog/2023/01/23/roadmap-of-2023.html) post.

## 3. VirtioFS

Also, as of the [v3.9.1 pre-release](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases/tag/v3.9.1) and specifically the Docker Desktop 4.16.1 version it ships with, macOS 12.5+ users can take advantage of the new VirtioFS file sharing layer which offers "you should definitely use it" performance improvements.

You can read more about that [here](https://docs.lando.dev/core/v3/performance.html#_1-virtiofs-on-macos).

## 4. WSL2 Default Install

Finally, [v3.9.1 pre-release](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases/tag/v3.9.1) introduces WSL2 as the default install method for Lando on Windows, which is MUCH faster than the previously recommended Hyper-V install.

See the [Windows installation instructions](https://docs.lando.dev/getting-started/installation.html#windows) for more details.
