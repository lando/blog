If you [haven't already heard](https://lando.dev/blog/2023/01/23/roadmap-of-2023.html) we've been diligently working on Lando 4 which has been **HARD** and will take awhile but will be worth it.

In the meantime we are trying to backport cool new Lando 4 features into Lando 3 when it makes sense and with the [Lando 3.14.0 prerelease](https://github.com/lando/lando/releases/tag/v3.14.0) its made sense for the first time. :)

That said, this prerelease is maybe more prereleasy than previous preleases so definitely only try it out if you are feeling **BOLD**.

## 1. New URL Scanner

Apps have gotten more complex since we first made Lando and as a consequence service start up times can now vary significantly across an application.

For that reason we've replaced the blocking `Scanning to determine which services are ready... Please stand by...` with real time scan updates which you can see in the GIF below.

Additionally, and also to reflect the increasing complexity of web apps, the scanner is much more configurable now.

```yaml
services:
  myservice:
    type: apache
    scanner:
      path: /ping
      timeout: 1000
      retry: 10
      okCodes:
        - 404
        - 444
```

You can read more about all of this in the [scanner docs](https://docs.lando.dev/core/v3/scanner.html). Try it out and if you have any issues [report them here](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues).

## 2. Pantheon SOLR8

We've added support for `solr8` in our `pantheon` recipe which you can set in your `pantheon.yml`.

**pantheon.yml**
```
search:
  version: 8
```

Then a `lando rebuild` to get the new stuff. Note that this is a first pass on the service and may not work 100% as expected. If you run into an issue please [report it here](https://github.com/lando/pantheon/issues).

Also be sure to check out the Pantheon docs for setting up SOLR on [Drupal](https://docs.pantheon.io/guides/solr-drupal/solr-drupal) and [WordPress](https://docs.pantheon.io/guides/wordpress-developer/wordpress-solr)

## 3. Other notable things

  * Added support for more `node` versions [lando/node](https://github.com/lando/node/releases/tag/v0.8.1)
  * Added support for `php:8.1` in `pantheon` recipes [lando/pantheon#132](https://github.com/lando/pantheon/issues/132)
  * Fixed issue when mounting `mysql:8` config [lando/lando#1462](https://github.com/lando/lando/issues/1462)
  * Fixed bug where uninstalled `pantheon` sites were not redirecting to `install.php` [lando/pantheon#139](https://github.com/lando/pantheon/issues/139)

## 4. What's next for Lando 3

### Healthcheck plugin?

Like the new URL scanner we want to remove the blocking `Waiting until X service is ready...` healthcheck in favor of realtime updates on said healtchecks.

### Lando update command?

As you [may know](https://lando.dev/blog/2023/01/23/roadmap-of-2023.html#lando-is-now-fully-decoupled) we spent a good part of 2022 breaking Lando up into smaller pieces so it would work more like a pluggable ecosystem than monorepo. While that effort has been completed our deployement and update pipeline is basically still the same; to update Lando you need to download and run a single large installer to get all the new stuff.

A `lando update` command would allow Lando to update the `cli`, `core` and all its `plugins` _as new versions of each become available_.

In this scenario you likely run the Lando installed once and then stay up to date continuously with `lando update`.

### Runtime 4 preview?

We will likely ship an `alpha` version of the Lando 4 runtime in the coming months that you can access via the current Lando 3 CLI.

The _ideal_ we are striving for here is that you should be able to add `runtime: 4` to your Landofile and `lando destroy && lando start` and spin up your app using the new runtime.

This means the Lando 4 runtime _should_ be able to understand your current Lando 3 Landofile although it will likely give you slightly different behavior. Similarly, the runtime should understand current Lando 3 CLI commands but also may give slightly different behavior.

We also are not 100% sure yet what work will be required to update the current set of official and non-core plugins or what order we will roll them out but if you are interested in helping with that we encourage you to join the [Lando Community](https://launchpass.com/devwithlando) and get in the `#contributors` channel.
